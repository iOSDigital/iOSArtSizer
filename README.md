iOSArtSizer
===========

A simple Mac app to help you create your iOS artwork

There are 2 sections in this app:

##Icon Creator

Drop a square PNG file (icon.png for example) and it will create individual PNGs in all different sizes, named with the dimensions (icon-114.png for example).

By default it saves the PNGs in the same directory as the source image.

##Retina resizer

Create your artwork at retina size, but don't add the @2x. Then drop in your PNG. It will copy the original and rename it "whatever@2x.png", and also resize it in half, and call it "whatever.png".
