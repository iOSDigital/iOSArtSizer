iOSArtSizer
===========

A simple Mac app to help you create your iOS artwork

There are 2 sections in this app:

###Icon Sizer

Drop a square PNG file(s) (icon.png for example) and it will create individual PNGs in all different sizes, named with the dimensions (icon-114.png for example).

By default it saves the PNGs in the same directory as the source image.

###Retina Sizer

Create your artwork at retina size, but don't add the @2x, then drop them in. It will copy the original and rename it "whatever@2x.png", and also resize it in half, and call that "whatever.png".


###To Do
* Make a nice icon
* Select a different directory to save output files
* Enable the size checkboxes in icon sizer
* Add your own size checkboxes in icon sizer
* Check original PNG file is valid
* Drop folders as well as files
* Drop onto Dock icon
* Created PNGs are bigger file size than photoshop PNGs - why?
